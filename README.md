# Downloading-bulk-FASTA-files
Here is the code for downloading the fasta files in bulk using a list of corresponding accession no.s
1) acc_to_fasta.py : This code requires you to input a list of accession numbers and download respective sequnces. Also, it helps you to create a desired mutation in the sequence and then create a new file with the mutated sequence. The file is first downloaded with the naming as accession.fasta and the mutated sequences carrying file is named as accession_mut.fasta where accession id the accession number.
2) easy downloada any fasta.py: This is the basic code that helps you to simply download any fasta file using its accession no.
3) mutate a sequence.py: This is the code to mutate a single residue in the sequence you input
